        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that inspires you to be someone greater than yourself. Someone that you turn to when times get tough.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		The hero that I most admire has the following characteristics:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Hard working - they work hardest when no one is watching</li>
        		<li>Makes the people around him better - knows what makes the people around him tick</li>
        		<li>Dedicated - does everthing with excellence</li>
        		<li>Humble - they do not tell their own stories</li>
        		<li>dependable - takes credit in bad and good times</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		To me, no man exemplifies these values more than Kobe Bryant.
